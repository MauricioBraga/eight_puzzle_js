# eight puzzle js

This is a version of the classic 8 puzzle game that I wrote as an programming example for an introductory HTML/CSS/Javascript course I taught years ago.

Keep in mind that the code is dirty (it was written quickly with no major concerns about readability or good coding practices) but it works perfectly (or at least it should. :-) ).

Comments in the code are in Portuguese, but any translator can solve this if you want, but the code is self explanatory and can be understood without the comments.

Enjoy!
